## Welcome

Game Frame is a game framework designed to simplify the creation of cross-platform multiplayer games for developers. With our framework, any developer will be able to easily integrate complex multiplayer features into their games.

Here is a list of some of Game Frame's features:

- simple user registration and login
- ability to list all joinable games
- lobbies for users to join before a game starts
- lobby chat system
- real-time events pushed across the network
- ability to send the "common view" (i.e. the board in a Monopoly) for display on a Chromecast-connected TV
- cross-platform play (currently supported on both Android devices and the web, more platforms to come)

While it is still under closed development, we will be open-sourcing it in the coming months. Stay tuned!
