## Welcome

Game Frame is a card/board game framework designed to simplify game development for developers. With our framework, any developer will be able to easily build a high-quality board or card game.

Here is a list of just some of Game Frame's features:

- simple user registration and login
- ability to list all joinable games
- waiting rooms for users to join before a game starts
- user-customizable game settings, synced across the network
- real-time events pushed across the network
- ability to send the "common view" (i.e. the board in a Monopoly) for display on a Chromecast-connected TV
- cross-platform play (our interface will be supported on both the web and Android devices)
- user messaging system

While it is still under closed development, we will be open-sourcing it in the coming months. Stay tuned!
